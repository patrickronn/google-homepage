# Google Homepage

## Description

This project is a recreation of the Google homepage. It also includes a recreation of a Google search results page when searching "build this webpage".
## Links to View in Browser
- [Recreated Google's Homepage](https://patrickronn.github.io/google-homepage/)
- [Recreated Google's Search Results Page](https://patrickronn.github.io/google-homepage/search.html)

Note: you can toggle between homepage and results page by clicking 'Google Search' and the small Google logo on the top left, respectively.

## Goal

My main goal is to:
- learn how elements are placed on Google's web pages, and
- understand how these elements are styled and aligned.

This is one of my first web development projects (and my first GitHub project).
