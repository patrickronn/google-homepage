# Google Homepage

## Description

This is one of my first web development projects (and my first GitHub project). This project is a re-creation of the Google homepage as well an example Google search results page.

## Goal

My main goal is to learn how elements are placed on Google's main web pages, and roughly how these elements are styled and aligned.
